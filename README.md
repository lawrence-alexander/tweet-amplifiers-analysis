Produce a .csv file of key account metadata for a maximum of 100 recent retweeters of a given Twitter status. Actual number of accounts returned will vary (I currently get around 80).
The numerical tweet ID can be found in the URL of the tweet (via Copy Link to Tweet) or through other API calls.

Example usage:

last_100_retweeters.py -i [tweet id]
